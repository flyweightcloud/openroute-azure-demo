# Demo of a Swaggerist driven Azure Function API

This Azure function demonstrates a combination of using Flyweight tools to build a simple Swagger API on an Azure function that can be consumed by PowerApps.

Also contains a basic devcontainer and CI pipeline which can be used to make changes to the function without an IDE.
